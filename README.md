# Socket - QOTD Server
This project implements a Quote of the Day (QOTD) server using Python's socket API. The server listens for incoming connections and sends a random quote when a client connects. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of socket programming, including creating a socket, binding it to a port, listening for connections, and sending/receiving data using TCP or UDP protocols.

The project includes both the server code and a client implementation, and can be tested locally or across multiple machines using virtual containers.
